ACCT 2101—Introductory Managerial AccountingCourse Description: Principles and   methods of accounting   primarily concerned with data      gathering and   presentation for   purposes of internal   management evaluation   and   decision-   making.
Nature and Purpose of the Course 
This course will   introduce you to the   principles and   methods of   managerial accounting, which is   primarily concerned with data gathering and   presentation for   purposes   of   internal   management evaluation and decision   making. 
The   prerequisite for Accounting 2101   is the successful completion   of Accounting   2000   or   2001 or equivalent. You will   need to apply   many   practical concepts   learned   in   those courses, including debits and credits, account analysis,   and   schedule   preparation.   It   may   prove   useful   to   have a financial accounting textbook accessible for   reference. 
Upon completion of this course, you will   have the   basic   understanding of the   kinds   of information available to assist   managers   in their decision   making. You will also   be   able to   prepare and   interpret common   reports and schedules. 
The   broad objectives of this   managerial accounting course are   listed   below:
•          The determination of cost   structure   and   its   impact   on   pricing   decisions   (Chapters   1,   2,   4,   and   8)
•          The development of techniques for   evaluating alternative   courses   of   action   and   decision   making   (Chapters   5, 6, 7,   and   12)
•          The development of   planning skills   and techniques   and   to   provide   tools   for   evaluation   of   results   (Chapters 9,   10, and   11)
Working with the Course Materials 
Remember, this course covers an entire   semester of work   or   the   equivalent   of   a   classroom course   lasting   15 weeks. That   means   that each   module   in this course equals   nearly   a week   of course work and will   require the same time and effort   on your   part. Do not expect to complete each module in a single study session. Understand, too, that if you choose to submit assignments at a very high pace, your instructor may not be able to grade your work at the same rate. 

Moodle 
Always   begin   by   logging in to our   Moodle course site.   The   course   is   divided   into   12   modules.   Each   module contains an introduction and descriptions   of the   elements   you   will   need   to   use on the WileyPLUS site.   It is   important to   read the   Module   Material   located   in the   Module
Introduction carefully   in order to successfully complete your work.   Its   purpose   is to   give you   a      brief overview of the   material you are about to   study.    After   reading the   Moodle   introduction,      you will   utilize study   resources and complete your graded assignment   in WileyPLUS.   Once you   complete your graded assignment on the WileyPLUS site,   it   is imperative that you   return   to
Moodle and verify completion of that   module’s assignment.
The course exams will also   be administered through   Moodle.   Please   see the   “Taking Your   Examinations” section of this syllabus for   more details   on   the   exam   procedures.

WileyPLUS 
The first time you   log on to the   Moodle course site, you will   need   to   read   the   instructions   for
creating your WileyPLUS account   in the “Getting Started”   module.   Most of the   course   activities,   including the online text, tutorials, and graded assignments,   are   conducted   in WileyPLUS.
Reading Assignments There are two ways for you to access your   reading assignment. You   may   use the   hard   copy   text   or you   may   read a ditigal version of the textbook on WileyPLUS. A   ditigal   version   is   available   in   WileyPLUS or can   be   purchased as a separate   downloable   e-book.
Recommended Activities 
There are several   recommended activities   in WileyPLUS to aid   in your   studying   for   each
module. These   resources are   located   under the   Modules tab   in WileyPLUS.    A checklist   has
been   provided for each   module and   includes a   list of available/recommended   resources.         The   resources available   include   lecture   presentation videos,   powerpoint   presentations, study
guides, accounting skill videos, example   problem videos, and   practice   problems. Additionally,
students   may   use Adaptive   Practice, a database of multiple choice   practice   questions.   Adaptive   Practice   is also accessed through the   modules tab in WileyPLUS.    As the   exams   consist   of
multiple choice questions, this tool can   provide   invaluable assistance   in   exam   preparation.
These   resources are highly recommended as study aids, but they are   not   required. They   may   be   viewed   unlimited times throughout the course.
Graded Assignments 
After studying each   module, you are to complete the   Graded Assignment   for   that   module   in
WileyPLUS. The assignment   is   labeled   by   module   number   under the   Modules tab   in WileyPLUS.
The assignments   include a variety of exercises from each   chapter. Your   response   to   each
exercise and   problem should   be well-researched and completed to the   best   of your   ability.   For   each exercise, you are allowed 3 attempts. When   each   attempt   is   used,   it   will   reveal   the
portions of the answer which you completed correctly. You will   be   allowed to   change   the
incorrect   portions on attempts 2 and 3.   The   third   attempt   is your   final   submission.   After   this   attempt, you will see a   link that will allow you to view the   solution   for   the   problem.
The graded assignments   may   be completed   in   multiple sessions within WileyPLUS. On   any
exercise, you   may save your work without   using an attempt. This   is   recommended   if you spend   considerable time on any exercise without submitting to   avoid   a   timeout   by the   website.
Once you   have completed the graded assignment in WileyPLUS,   return to   the   appropriate module   in   Moodle to verify that you   have submitted the graded assignment. The assignment will not be entered into the grade book if you do not verify submission in Moodle. 
Working with the Textbook 
Whether you are   using the online version or   hard copy   of the   text,   it   is   a   good   idea   to
familiarize yourself with the setup of the textbook   by   looking thr代 写ACCT 2101—Introductory Managerial Accounting
代做程序编程语言ough   it and   noting   specific
features designed to facilitate   learning. You will find the following features   particularly   helpful   with this   course:
Learning Objectives 
Each chapter   is   broken down   into   multiple   learning objectives. These are   labeled   in the   left
margin of the textbook.   It   is a good   idea to   note these   as you   read   the   chapter   and   ensure   that   you are   mastering the   key concepts   listed.
End of Chapter Resources 
At the end of each chapter,   between the   body   of the text   material   and   the   homework   materials, are several features   useful for   review.
Learning Objectives Review summarizes the   main   points of the chapter.
Practice Problem gives students another opportunity to   see   a   detailed   solution   to   a   representative   problem   before they do   homework assignments.
Suggested Study Techniques 
1.       Carefully   review the   module objectives to   help you focus   on   the   information   that   will   be covered on   the   exams.
2.       Concentrate on the   reading assignments, the   module   lecture   material,   and   any
additional   resources   provided. This   review should   include a detailed examination   of   any   illustrative   problems and examples. After an assignment   has   been   completed,   a   rapid   re-reading of the   related text and other   materials   is strongly   recommended.
3.       Put yourself on a   definite   schedule.   Set   aside   a   certain   block   of   hours   per   day   or week   for this course and work   in a   place where distractions   are   minimal.
4.       Try to submit one   assignment   each week   or   at   least   every two   weeks.   Delays   in
submitting assignments   usually   result   in   lagging   interest and the   inability to complete   the   course.
5.       Review your   module assignments   after they   have   been   graded,   paying   special   attention to any   instructor feedback   provided.
6.       Regardless of   how you complete your   graded   assignments,   keep   in   mind   that   module   completion should   not   be your sole   preparation for your exams. As with   any   college course, you should study for your   exams.
Reading Assignments 
To do well   in this course, it   is essential   that   you   read   and   study   the   course   materials   that
precede the   module assignment.   Do   not   begin the   module assignment   until you   have done so.
For each type of assignment you   prepare for this course,   follow   carefully   the   guidelines   provided   in the textbook and this course website.
You will   read an average of 25   pages   per   module. Specific   reading   assignments   will   be   given   in   each   module.

Final Examination
Module Assignments 
Each completed   module assignment   is worth   10   points.   Each completed   module assignment   will   receive a   point value. The   module assignments are graded   in WileyPLUS. The   points   for         each   module are   prorated   between the exercises   in   the   module assignment.   Partial credit   is         given for all correct   parts within   an   exercise.
Homework completion   is   primarily for your   benefit and   is the   key to success   in   this   course.   If
you   have difficulty with any aspect of this course,   you   may   post   a   question   in   the   forum   section   for the   module.
It   is   highly   recommended that you take the exams as you   proceed   in the   course   and   do   not
wait   until after submission of all   modules to   begin taking the   exams.   Taking   the   exams   in   the proper order of the course will allow you to   receive   feedback   on your   progress   before   it   is   too   late to   make   improvements   in your study   methods   if   needed.
Carefully study the textbook and   recommended activities   in WileyPLUS   before you   begin to   prepare the graded   module assignments. This study should   include   a   detailed   examination   of   the   illustrative   problems and examples, as well as the assigned   reading. After   an   assignment         has   been completed, a   rapid   re-reading of the   related text and   other   materials   is   strongly recommended.
You should submit each   module assignment as   soon   as   it   is   completed.   Some   courses   have
restrictions that   require that a grade   be   received   before you can submit   additional
assignments. Specific   information on assignment submission   is   included   in the   Module   Instructions.   Please   be sure to follow these   instructions.
Once you submit an assignment, you cannot   revise   it, so   be sure to   check your   work.   Your   instructor will   normally   post a grade for your assignment within seven calendar days. 
Understand that occasional delays will occur, such   as   during   holidays   and   semester   breaks   or   if   you submit several   module assignments within the same week.
Do   not   rely too   heavily on your textbook or other   resource   material when   preparing your
assignments.   If you do, you   may   not   realize   until exam time that the   perfect   response you
prepared for an assignment was only   possible   because you   referred to   resource   material
without   really   learning or understanding the   material and concepts. Therefore, you should 
attempt each assignment without referring to the resource material, and   if you find   it   necessary   to   look   up an answer,   be sure you   have actually   learned the concept   and   material   rather   than      merely   reflecting   it   in the answer.
